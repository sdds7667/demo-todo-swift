This is a demonstration of a todo app with Vim-style keybindings and priority functionality. It provides a simple interface for managing tasks and allows you to efficiently navigate and manipulate your todo list using familiar Vim-style commands.


## Features

- Vim keybindings: The todo app supports a subset of Vim commands for navigation, editing, and task management. Users familiar with Vim can leverage their knowledge to efficiently interact with the app.
- Priority: Tasks can be assigned different priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to help you prioritize your work and focus on what's important.
